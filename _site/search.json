Using behavioral, self-report, pupil size, and neuroimaging methods I have studied how individuals differ on their ability to control attention. My program of research focuses on 1) how attention control relates to other cognitive abilities such as working memory capacity and fluid intelligence, 2) how to improve the measurement of attention control, and 3) brain mechanisms underlying differences in attention control.\n\n\n\n\nPh.D. in Cognition and Brain Sciences ∙ Georgia Tech ∙ 2022\n\n\nM.S. in Experimental Psychology ∙ CSU, San Bernardino ∙ 2014\n\n\nB.A. in Behavioral Neuroscience ∙ Western Washington University ∙ 2011"

    "text": "About me\n\n\nI am originally from Bothell, WA (~30 miles north of Seattle). I will always consider Washington State as my home. I earned my B.A. in Behavioral Neuroscience at Western Washington University. This is where I found my interest in cognitive psychology, Buddhism, meditation, and contemplative practices more generally. I took a year off after college to participate in an 8-week silent meditation retreat on Shamatha and the Four Immeasurables in Phuket, Thailand with my teacher Alan Wallace.\nFrom there I went on to do a 2 year M.A. program in General Experimental Psychology at California State University, San Bernardino (CSUSB). At CSUSB I worked with Dr. Hideya Koshino doing research on selective attention and working memory.\nI was, then, accepted into Randy Engle’s lab as a Ph.D. student at Georgia Tech. I graduated with my Ph.D. in December 2022 and worked as a post-doc with Randy for a year and a half. My research in the lab involved investigating the nature of attention control with the use of pupillometry. I made use of the R statistical programming language to analyze data in a way that is most consistent with open science and reproducibility practices. I had developed several R Packages relevant to the lab’s research.\nI then went on to do a post-doc with Amishi Jha at the University of Miami in 2024 to extend the work I had done at Georgia Tech in an area that is very near to my heart, mindfulness and meditation. This has been a great opportunity for me to get involved in an area of research I am both academically and personally passionate about.\nOutside of psychology, my interests include Buddhist spiritual practice (mainly influenced by the Nyingma tradition from Tibetan Buddhism and Dzogchen teachings in particular), teaching meditation and mindfulness practices, hiking, camping, riding my bicycle around town, and photography."

    "section": "",
    "text": "There has been some controversy as to whether baseline pupil size is related to individual differences in cognitive ability. Previously, we had shown that a larger baseline pupil size was associated with higher cognitive ability and that the correlation to fluid intelligence was larger than that to working memory capacity (Tsukahara, Harrison, & Engle, 2016). However, other researchers have not been able to replicate our findings – though they only measured working memory capacity and not fluid intelligence. Many of the studies showing no relationship had major methodological issues, namely small baseline pupil size values – down to the physiological minimum that resulted in reduced variability on baseline pupil size. We conducted two large-scale studies to investigate how different lighting conditions affect baseline pupil size values and the correlation with cognitive abilities. We found that fluid intelligence, working memory capacity, and attention control did correlate with baseline pupil size except in the brightest lighting conditions. We showed that a reduced variability in baseline pupil size values is due to the monitor settings being too bright. Overall, our findings demonstrated that the baseline pupil size working memory capacity relationship was not as strong or robust as that with fluid intelligence or attention control. Our findings have strong methodological implications for researchers investigating individual differences in task-free or task-evoked pupil size. We conclude that fluid intelligence does correlate with baseline pupil size and that this is related to the functional organization of the resting-state brain through the locus coeruleus-norepinephrine system."

    "text": "Individual differences in the ability to control attention are correlated with a wide range of important outcomes, from academic achievement and job performance to health behaviors and emotion regulation. Nevertheless, the theoretical nature of attention control as a cognitive construct has been the subject of heated debate, spurred on by psychometric issues that have stymied efforts to reliably measure differences in the ability to control attention. For theory to advance, our measures must improve. We introduce three efficient, reliable, and valid tests of attention control that each take less than 3 min to administer; Stroop Squared, Flanker Squared, and Simon Squared. Two studies (online and in-lab) comprising more than 600 participants demonstrate that the three “Squared” tasks have great internal consistency (avg. = .95) and test–retest reliability across sessions (avg. r = .67). Latent variable analyses revealed that the Squared tasks loaded highly on a common factor (avg. loading = .70), which was strongly correlated with an attention control factor based on established measures (avg. r = .81). Moreover, attention control correlated strongly with fluid intelligence, working memory capacity, and processing speed and helped explain their covariation. We found that the Squared attention control tasks accounted for 75 percent of the variance in multitasking ability at the latent level, and that fluid intelligence, attention control, and processing speed fully accounted for individual differences in multitasking ability. Our results suggest that Stroop Squared, Flanker Squared, and Simon Squared are reliable and valid measures of attention control."

According to process overlap theory, cognitive tasks tap domain-general executive processes as well as domain-specific processes, and correlations between measures reflect the degree of overlap in the cognitive processes that are engaged when performing the tasks. In this article, we discuss points of agreement and disagreement between the executive attention framework and process overlap theory, with a focus on attention control, the domain-general ability to maintain focus on task-relevant information and disengage from irrelevant and no-longer relevant information. After describing the steps our lab has taken to improve the measurement of attention control, we review evidence suggesting that attention control can explain many of the positive correlations between broad cognitive abilities, such as fluid intelligence, working memory capacity, and sensory discrimination ability. Furthermore, when these latent variables are modeled under a higher-order g factor, attention control has the highest loading on g, indicating a strong relationship between attention control and domain-general cognitive ability. In closing, we reflect on the challenge of directly measuring cognitive processes and provide suggestions for future research."

However, there is also evidence to suggest that visual arrays task performance reflects individual differences in controlled processing. The purpose of this study was to empirically evaluate the degree to which visual arrays tasks are more closely related to memory storage capacity or measures of attention control. To this end, we conducted new analyses on a series of large data sets that incorporate various versions of a visual arrays task. Based on these analyses, we suggest that the degree to which the visual arrays is related to memory storage ability or effortful attention control may be task-dependent. Specifically, when versions of the task require participants to ignore elements of the target display, individual differences in controlled attention reliably provide unique predictive value. Therefore, at least some versions of the visual arrays tasks can be used as valid indicators of individual differences in attention control."

However, the question remains as to whether rationality and intelligence are empirically distinct, as does the question of what cognitive mechanisms underlie individual differences in rationality.

Latent factors representing rationality and general intelligence were strongly correlated (r = .54), but their correlation fell well short of unity. Rationality correlated significantly with fluid intelligence (r = .56), working memory capacity (r = .44), and attention control (r = .49). Attention control fully accounted for the relationship between working memory capacity and rationality, and partially accounted for the relationship between fluid intelligence and rationality.

    "text": "Across two studies (N &gt; 800), we investigated the contributions of acquired knowledge, attention control, and psychomotor ability to performance in complex simulated work paradigms. Study 1 was conducted online and included three-minute “Squared” tests of attention control and two tests of acquired knowledge, the Wonderlic and the Armed Forces Qualification Test. Although all measures predicted performance at the bivariate level, hierarchical regression analyses and structural equation modeling revealed that acquired knowledge did not account for significant incremental validity above and beyond attention control, whereas attention control accounted for substantial variance above and beyond the other predictors. Study 2 was conducted in-lab and included tests of attention control and versions of two official U.S. Military selection tests; the Armed Forces Qualification Test and the Performance-Based Measures assessment, a subtest of the Aviation Selection Test Battery. Attention control fully mediated the relationship between the Performance Based Measures and simulated work performance. Attention control measures also demonstrated slightly smaller gender differences in performance than the Performance Based Measures. We discuss the implications of these results from theoretical and applied perspectives."

    "text": "The ability to sustain attention over time and the maintenance of information in working memory are highly overlapping constructs. Many tasks used to measure sustained attention rely heavily on the maintenance of information in working memory to sustain continuous task performance over large periods of time. To further understand the relationship between sustained attention and working memory, we tested whether the ability to sustain the focus of attention over a relatively short period of time (e.g., 12 seconds) is related to cognitive abilities such as working memory capacity and attention control. We used a novel paradigm, the sustained attention-to-cue task, to manipulate the duration attention had tobe sustained at a cued location; none (0 seconds), short (2–5 seconds), medium (5.5–8.5 seconds), and long (9–12 seconds). We found that attention waned and accuracy decreased as the wait time got longer. Those higher on attention control ability, had less of a decline in accuracy as the wait time got longer. However, the decline in accuracy as wait time got longer was not related to working memory capacity, fluid intelligence, or multitasking. These findings challenge how we think about sustained attention and working memory capacity, and the nature of attention control more generally."

    "section": "",
    "text": "In this chapter, we detail our approach to the study of individual differences in working memory capacity (WMC) and how it has contributed to understanding the mechanisms of complex cognition. Theories of working memory have primarily focused on specifying how information is represented and manipulated in a limited-capacity cognitive system. Individuals differ in the efficacy of their working memory systems, forming the basis for WMC as a psychometric construct. Decades of research have shown that WMC is predictive of a broad range of abilities and outcomes (Engle, 2002; Engle & Kane, 2004; Feldman-Barrett, Tugade, & Engle, 2004). One of the most robust and, we believe, important findings is that WMC strongly predicts fluid intelligence (Gf), the ability to solve novel problems and learn new information (Kane, Hambrick, & Conway, 2005; Kyllonen & Christal, 1990). A central feature of many models of the working memory system is a domain-general executive attention, sometimes called a central executive, which regulates other components of the system (Baddeley & Hitch, 1974; Cowan, 1999). We argue that this attentional component forms the basis of the WMC–Gf relationship."

    "text": "There is an increasing consensus among researchers that traditional attention tasks do not validly index the attentional mechanisms that they are often used to assess. We recently tested and validated several existing, modified, and new tasks and found that accuracy-based and adaptive tasks were more reliable and valid measures of attention control than traditional ones, which typically rely on speeded responding and/or contrast comparisons in the form of difference scores (Draheim et al., 2021). With these improved measures, we found that attention control fully mediated the working memory capacity-fluid intelligence relationship, a novel finding that we argued has significant theoretical implications. The present study was both a follow-up and extension to this “toolbox approach” to measuring attention control. Here, we tested updated versions of several attention control tasks in a new dataset (N = 301) and found, with one exception, that these tasks remain strong indicators of attention control. The present study also replicated two important findings; 1) that attention control accounted for nearly all the variance in the relationship between working memory capacity and fluid intelligence, and 2) that the strong association found between attention control and other cognitive measures is not because the attention control tasks place strong demands on processing speed. These findings show that attention control can be measured as a reliable and valid individual differences construct and thatattention control shares substantial variance with other executive functions."

However, the relationship between pupil size and individual differences in cognitive ability is not as well studied. A peculiar finding that has cropped up in this research is that those high on cognitive ability have a larger pupil size, even during a passive baseline condition. Yet these findings were incidental and lacked a clear explanation. Therefore, in the present series of studies we systematically investigated whether pupil size during a passive baseline is associated with individual differences in working memory capacity and fluid intelligence. Across three studies we consistently found that baseline pupil size is, in fact, related to cognitive ability. We showed that this relationship could not be explained by differences in mental effort, and that the effect of working memory capacity and fluid intelligence on pupil size persisted even after 23 sessions and taking into account the effect of novelty or familiarity with the environment. We also accounted for potential confounding variables such as; age, ethnicity, and drug substances. Lastly, we found that it is fluid intelligence, more so than working memory capacity, which is related to baseline pupil size.

An ongoing debate among attention researchers is whether conflict resolution mechanisms are task-specific or domain-general, and the lack of correlation between most attention measures seems to favor the view that attention control is not a unitary concept. We have argued that the use of difference scores, particularly in reaction time (RT), is the primary cause of null and conflicting results at the individual differences level, and that methodological issues with existing tasks preclude making strong theoretical conclusions. The present article is an empirical test of this view in which we used a toolbox approach to develop and validate new tasks hypothesized to reflect attention processes. Here, we administered existing, modified, and new attention tasks to over 400 participants (final N = 396). Compared with the traditional Stroop and flanker tasks, performance on the accuracy-based measures was more reliable, had stronger intercorrelations, formed a more coherent latent factor, and had stronger associations to measures of working memory capacity and fluid intelligence. Further, attention control fully accounted for the relationship between working memory capacity and fluid intelligence. These results show that accuracy-based measures can be better suited to individual differences investigations than traditional RT tasks, particularly when the goal is to maximize prediction.

However, there remain considerable gaps in our understanding of how cognitive mechanisms that underpin intelligence map onto various brain functions. In this article, we argue that the locus coeruleus-norepinephrine system is essential for understanding the biological basis of intelligence. We review evidence suggesting that the locus coeruleus–norepinephrine system plays a central role at all levels of brain function, from metabolic processes to the organization of large-scale brain networks. We connect this evidence with our executive attention view of working-memory capacity and fluid intelligence and present analyses on baseline pupil size, an indicator of locus coeruleus activity. Using a latent variable approach, our analyses showed that a common executive attention factor predicted baseline pupil size. Additionally, the executive attention function of disengagement––not maintenance––uniquely predicted baseline pupil size. These findings suggest that the ability to control attention may be important for understanding how cognitive mechanisms of fluid intelligence map onto the locus coeruleus–norepinephrine system. We discuss how further research is needed to better understand the relationships between fluid intelligence, the locus coeruleus–norepinephrine system, and functionally organized brain networks."

    "text": "Why do some individuals learn more quickly than others, or perform better in complex cognitive tasks? In this article, we describe how differential and experimental research methods can be used to study intelligence in humans and non-human animals. More than one hundred years ago, Spearman (1904) discovered a general factor underpinning performance across cognitive domains in humans. Shortly thereafter, Thorndike (1935) discovered positive correlations between cognitive performance measures in the albino rat. Today, research continues to shed light on the underpinnings of the positive manifold observed among ability measures. In this review, we focus on the relationship between cognitive performance and attention control; the domain-general ability to maintain focus on task-relevant information while preventing attentional capture by task-irrelevant thoughts and events. Recent work from our laboratory has revealed that individual differences in attention control can largely explain the positive associations between broad cognitive abilities such as working memory capacity and fluid intelligence. In research on mice, attention control has been closely linked to a general ability factor reflecting route learning and problem solving. Taken together, both lines of research suggest that individual differences in attention control underpin performance in a variety of complex cognitive tasks, helping to explain why measures of cognitive ability correlate positively. Efforts to find confirmatory and dis-confirmatory evidence across species stands to improve not only our understanding of attention control, but cognition in general."
