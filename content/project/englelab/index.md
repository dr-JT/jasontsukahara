### An R package for processing complex-span and attention control tasks downloaded from the EngleLab

There are functions for the Advanced, Foster Shortened, Oswald Shortened, and Standard versions of the complex-span tasks, as well as functions for the Attention Control tasks.

There are also functions to assist in processing and cleaning the data. These include dealing with outliers with replace_outliers(), calculating composite scores from a group of variables with composite(), and removing those with too much missing data on a construct with remove_missing().
