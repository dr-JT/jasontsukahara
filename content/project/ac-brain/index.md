title: Brain Mechanisms of Attention Control
date: '2022-09-25T00:00:00Z'

summary: To better understand the nature of attention control and why it is highly predictive of a wide-range of behaviors we need to discover the brain mechanisms underlying such differences. I believe the locus coeruleus-norepinephrine system is central to explaining brain mechanisms underlying attention control ability.

## Latest Updates

I am currently conducting a large-sample (N = 200+) fMRI study to investigate the relationship between attention control, functional connectivity, and the locus coeruleus-norepinephrine system.
