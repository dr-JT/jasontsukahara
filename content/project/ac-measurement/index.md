title: The Measurement of Attention Control
date: '2022-08-25T00:00:00Z'

summary: Measurement and theory are entwined; without adequate measurement, theoretical conclusions rest on tenuous ground. I study the measurement of people's ability to control their attention and have developed novel tasks that are both reliable and valid measures of attention control.

## Description

Measurement and theory are entwined; without adequate measurement, theoretical conclusions rest on tenuous ground. To understand the nature of attention control as a cognitive construct, we need tasks with strong psychometric properties that produce systematic differences in performance across individuals. 

Unfortunately, the study of individual differences in the ability to control attention has been hindered by measures that are notoriously unreliable. Therefore, we have been working on improving the measurement of attention control by modifying existing measures and developing novel tasks. 

Our position is that individual differences in the ability to control attention can be reliably measured and they underpin a wide range of cognitive functions, from problem solving and maintaining information in working memory to processing information rapidly and multitasking. That said, it is critical that we continue to refine our tools, including not only our tasks but also our experimental and statistical approaches.
