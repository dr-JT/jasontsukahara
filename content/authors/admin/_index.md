# Hi there,
{style="text-align: justify;"}

I am currently a post-doctoral researcher in the [Attention & Working Memory Lab](https://englelab.gatech.edu) at Georgia Tech working with [Randy Engle](https://englelab.gatech.edu/engle.html).
{style="text-align: justify;"}

As a cognitive psychologist and practicing Buddhist, I am curious about the ways in which we use attention, how well we are able to use it, and how it impacts our mind and life in meaningful ways. 
{style="text-align: justify;"}

Currently my research focuses on individual differences in the ability to control attention and how that relates to cognitive abilities, sustained attention, pupil size, and the locus coeruleus-norepinephrine system.
