# Hi there,
{style="text-align: justify;"}

I am currently a post-doctoral researcher in the [Attention & Working Memory Lab](https://englelab.gatech.edu) at Georgia Tech working with [Randy Engle](https://englelab.gatech.edu/engle.html).
{style="text-align: justify;"}

As a cognitive psychologist and practicing Buddhist contemplative, I am curious about the ways in which we use our attention, how well we are able to use it, and how it impacts our mind and life in meaningful ways. 
{style="text-align: justify;"}

Currently my research focuses on individual differences in the ability to control attention and how that relates to cognitive abilities, sustained attention, pupil size, and the locus coeruleus-norepinephrine system. 

## A little more about me

I am originally from Seattle, WA. I will always consider Washington State as my home. I earned my B.A. in Behavioral Neuroscience at Western Washington University. This is where I found my interests in cognitive psychology. I took a year off after college. During that year off I particpated in an 8-week silent meditation retreat on Shamatha and the Four Immeasurables in Phuket, Thailand with my teacher Alan Wallace

From there I went on to do a 2 year M.A. program in General Experimental Psychology at California State University, San Bernardino (CSUSB). At CSUSB I worked with Dr. Hideya Koshino doing research on selective attention and working memory.

I was, then, accepted into Randy Engle’s lab as a Ph.D. student at Georgia Tech. My current research in the lab involves investigating the nature of attention control with the use of pupillometry. I make use of the R statistical programming language to analyze data in a way that is most consistent with open science and reproducibility practices. I have developed several R Packages relevant to the lab's research; see below.

Outside of psychology, my interests include Buddhist spiritual practice, hiking, camping, riding my bicycle around town, and photography.
