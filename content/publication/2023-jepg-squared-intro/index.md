abstract: Individual differences in the ability to control attention are correlated with a wide range of important outcomes, from academic achievementand job performance to health behaviors and emotion regulation. Nevertheless, the theoretical nature of attention control as a cognitive construct has beenthe subject of heated debate, spurred on by psychometricissuesthat have stymied efforts to reliably measuredifferencesin the ability to control attention. For theory to advance, our measures must improve. We introducethree efficient, reliable, and valid tests of attention control that each take less thanthree minutes to administer; Stroop Squared, Flanker Squared, and Simon Squared. Two studies (online and in-lab) comprising more than 600participants demonstratethat the three “Squared” tasks havegreat internal consistency (avg.r = .95) and test-retest reliability across sessions (avg.r = .67). Latent variable analyses revealed that the Squaredtasks loaded highlyon a common factor, which was stronglycorrelated with an attention control factor based onestablished measures (avg.r = .81). Moreover, attention controlcorrelated strongly with fluid intelligence,working memory capacity, and processing speed,and helped explain their covariation.We found that the Squared attention control tasks accountedfor 75% ofthe variance in multitasking abilityat the latent level, and that fluid intelligence, attention control, and processing speed fully accounted for individual differences in multitasking ability. Our results suggest that Stroop Squared, Flanker Squared, and Simon Squared are reliable and valid indicators of attention control. The tasks are freely availableonline.
